## BlackJack Game

I'm building this blackjack game to revamp my Javascript skills. I'll be updating this game based on new ideas that makes the game better.

Pending ideas:
1. Change "You're out of the game!ðŸ˜”" to red
2. Reset the game once a player has got blackjack
3. Let the winner have some chips - say $100
